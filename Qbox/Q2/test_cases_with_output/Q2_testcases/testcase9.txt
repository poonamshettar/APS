 “You know, I think oyster-crabs are perhaps the most selfish of all the sea
 animals,” began daddy. “The oyster-crabs really belong to the crab family.
 They are called oyster-crabs, however, because above all things they love
 the juice of an oyster and absolutely live on it. And what I am going to tell
 you about now is the way they get it.
 “First of all, the oyster-crab hovers around the oysters and then picks out
 a nice, fat, juicy looking oyster, saying to himself: ‘You look as if you could
 feed me well without any effort. I think I will crawl into your shell.’ So then
 he crawls right inside the oyster’s shell and proceeds to enjoy himself. He
 prefers just to ‘sponge’ on others, as the expression goes!”
