 Going to the dentist’s always frightened Evelyn. “Dear me,” said daddy, “I
 think I will have to tell you about the brownie’s trip to the dentist, for I
 think his case was very similar to yours.
 “This little brownie had had a toothache which had bothered him for
 some time, but he dreaded to go to the dentist’s, just the way you do.
 “One day, though, it got awfully painful and he felt he could stand it no
 longer. He went right off to see the brownie dentist. He was a very clever
 dentist and very kind and gentle. He got a pair of pullers, and after a
 moment or two Dr. Brownie said:
 “‘Well, here’s the old toothache.’
 “‘What, my tooth already out?’ said the little brownie. ‘And to think of
 all I’ve suffered before I came to you.’”
