 “‘It’s a little bird,’ said Ella, as she looked out of the window.
’  “They opened the window and Ella took the little bird in her hands.
 Oh,  how cold the little bird’s feathers were!  “‘We’ll take care of you,’ said Ella.
 They gave the little bird some bread crumbs and some water.
  “Pretty soon the bird began to grow much better and hopped and chirped  about the room, and then they let him out for he had simply been very  hungry.
’  “So the little bird was given a regular New Year’s feast, and Ella and her  friends were among other children who decided to look after the feathered  people through the cold months of the winter and to give them bread crumbs and suet which they love so well.
