: +1-978-934-3259  Featured Application: Despite their reported high accuracy, a significant limitation of current  AI-assisted COVID-19 diagnostic models is that they are often trained on datasets sourced from  specific clinics or possessing a limited number of training images.
  Through multi-level testing, we assessed the models’ capacities for verification, interpolation,  and extrapolation in the context of diagnosing COVID-19 and pneumonia using multi-center X ray images.
  Multi-Level Training and Testing of  CNNModelsinDiagnosing  Multi-Center COVID-19 and  Pneumonia X-ray Images.
  Abstract: This study aimed to address three questions in AI-assisted COVID-19 diagnostic systems:  (1) How does a CNNmodeltrained on one dataset perform on test datasets from disparate medical  centers? (2) What accuracy gains can be achieved by enriching the training dataset with new images?  (3) How can learned features elucidate classification results, and how do they vary among different  models? To achieve these aims, four CNN models—AlexNet, ResNet-50, MobileNet, and VGG 19—were trained in five rounds by incrementally adding new images to a baseline training set  comprising 11,538 chest X-ray images.
 Heatmaps and intermediate activation features  showed visual correlations to COVID-19 and pneumonia X-ray manifestations but were insufficient  to explicitly explain the classification.

 Introduction  Over the past few years, there has been a surge in studies exploring deep learning  techniques to diagnose COVID-19 and pneumonia.
 Systematic reviews of AI-enabled  COVID-19detection can be foundin[1–3] in 2021, [4–10] in 2022, and [11–13] in 2023.
 Because COVID 19 medical images were still limited in 2021, prior studies often focused on demonstrating  the feasibility of deep learning models in distinguishing COVID-19 cases from normal  subjects or patients with other respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia [14–16].
  With the increasing availability of COVID-19 X-rays and CT scans since 2021, research  has pivoted to comparing various machine learning models and developing new models  tailored for COVID-19 detection.
  With the increasing availability of COVID-19 X-rays and CT scans since 2021, research  has pivoted to comparing various machine learning models and developing new models  tailored for COVID-19 detection.
 [30] considered 20 CNN models  for COVID-19 detection, including EfficientNet-B5, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, ResNet-50,  and VGG16, using 4173 CT images, and demonstrated that EfficientNet-B5 and ResNet-50  were persistently superior in accuracy and sensitivity, followed by DenseNet, Efficient Net, and Xception, while VGG-19 remained the lowest across models.
 [33] achieved a  98% accuracy of COVID-19 prediction using 243 X-ray images, which outperformed In ception V3, VGG16, ResNet-50, DenseNet121, and MobileNet when tested individually.
 However, only 263 original X-ray images (including 56 normal,  49 COVID-19, and 128 pneumonia) were used, which were increased to 3325 images for  each category through augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and shifting.

82% for multi-class classification (normal,  COVID-19, pneumonia).
  In summary, researchers have achieved accuracy levels exceeding 95% for COVID-19  detection through the selection and refinement of appropriate CNN models.
 It is also noted that even though the COVID-19  datasets have become more available, most have not been validated and can be subject  to mislabeling, noise, incompleteness, corruption, or low quality [46–49].
  In this scenario, will the high accuracy of trained models be maintained when tested on  larger data or images from other clinics? If not, how much lower accuracy will be expected  and/or tolerated? Will adding new images to the original training dataset always improve  the model’s performance, and what level of improvement can be expected via re-training  the model with extended data? To achieve a desirable classification accuracy, how many  newimages should be added to the original training dataset?  The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of CNN models in diag nosing COVID-19 and pneumonia in the lungs based on X-ray images from different data  sources, as well as to assess the performance variation from multi-level training.
 COVID-19 and Pneumonia Datasets from Multiple Sources  Chest X-ray images were selected from three sources, with each source encompassing  the categories of normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia.
 COVID-19 and Pneumonia Datasets from Multiple Sources  Chest X-ray images were selected from three sources, with each source encompassing  the categories of normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia.
 The first dataset [50–52] contains  10,192 normal cases, 3616 COVID-19 positive cases, and 1345 viral pneumonia images.
 Among the  11,538 training images, 7791 are normal, 2712 are COVID-19, and 1030 are viral pneumonia,  constituting a disproportionate distribution of 68%, 24%, and 9%, respectively.
 Likewise,  among the 3035 testing images, 2032 are normal, 742 are COVID-19, and 261 are viral  pneumonia.
 Three sample images typical of normal, COVID-19, and viral pneumonia cases  are also shown below.

 Even  though the X-ray images acquired at any medical center share inherent similarities among  COVID-19 patients, differences among COVID-19 images can exist across medical centers,  and the performance of the pre-trained model can be affected by such differences.

 In each test, a three-class classification (normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia) was  performed.
 These procedures will be tested on four models  (AlexNet, ResNet-50, MobileNet, and VGG-19) for three-class classifications (normal, COVID-19,  and pneumonia).

 After four  more rounds of training by exposing them to an incrementally enriched dataset, the  heatmaps in Round 5 appeared more indicative and intuitive than in Round 1 with respect  to the clinical manifestations, which exhibited a clear lung in the normal case, dispersed  opacities and occasional hotspots in COVID-19, and a large region of hotspots in the lower  lobes in pneumonia.

 Thus, these four models are all good candidates for developing  AI-assisted COVID-19 diagnostic systems, as also suggested by many previous studies.

 Dataset Effects  In this study, three datasets of X-ray images for normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia  were utilized.
 Even though data argumentation techniques have  been useful when the COVID-19 images were limited, training unmodified images is  recommended when COVID-19 X-rays become more available.

 Thus,  standardization and validation of image databases and repositories, which are lacking in  most public COVID-19 X-ray datasets, are needed to avoid future complications.

 By contrast, the classification for COVID-19-pneumonia is much rarer.
 It is also noted that COVID-19 has been  proven to be highly mutational, and existing datasets cannot fully account for the evolving  variants.
 This will increase the likelihood for a future COVID-19 patient to receive a false  negative diagnosis, which makes multi-round training imperative to ensure the accuracy  of AI-assisted COVID-19 diagnostic systems.

 COVID-19 X-ray images may show patchy areas of opacity,  which indicate fluid buildup in the lungs [58,59].
 Additionally, COVID-19 may cause a  condition called “ground-glass opacity”, which appears as a hazy, cloud-like pattern.
 Conclusions  Despite reported high accuracies, many previous CNN-based COVID-19 diagnostic  models relied on clinic-specific or limited datasets and were rarely tested with external  images.
